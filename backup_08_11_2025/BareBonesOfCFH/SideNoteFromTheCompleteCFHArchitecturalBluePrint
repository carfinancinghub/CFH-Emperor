This is an excellent final step for this architectural phase. A clean, well-documented backup is critical. I will help you with both the cleanup and the final blueprint.

File Cleanup Analysis
I have analyzed the complete file lists you provided for the converted to TS and converted to TSX directories against the final architecture we have built together. Below is the breakdown of which files are part of our new, unified system and which appear to be legacy files that can be reviewed for archival.
